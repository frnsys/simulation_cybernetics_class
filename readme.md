Listed description:

> [Tracks C, M] This course will examine the usage of models, simulations, and games as ways of exploring, understanding, and critiquing various systems - ecological, social, economic, and/or political. Students will dissect and discuss classic models such as Schelling's Model of Segregation and Sugarscape, in addition to narrative applications, such as Vertu and Dwarf Fortress. Throughout the course students will learn various techniques for developing these models and will collectively design and implement a series of simple interactive simulations on topics of their choosing, such as voting, social media, and opinion flow and influence dynamics. Students should come with some prior programming experience, ideally with Python. An introductory Python course is offered in parallel for students without prior programming experience. Important note: Students must bring their own laptops to class.

## What you'll get out of this course

- a new way of looking at the world, which hopefully leads to many new ways of looking at the world
- skills in expressing systems in a variety of ways: diagrams, code, etc
- methods for thinking through complex problems, identifying where to intervene in complicated issues

You'll be given class time to work on projects -- this is a good opportunity to ask questions, get feedback, etc. But it's unlikely that this in-class time alone will be enough to finish the projects.

## Assignments

### Assignment #1

Choose a system that is interesting or relevant to you. Map it out as a system map in as much detail as you can, using a combination of a causal loop diagram and a stock and flow diagram.

Some things to consider: Who are the individuals, organizations, groups, etc involved? What parts of the system do the affect, and what parts of the system affect them? What technologies or natural phenomena are involved, if any? What are important indications of the system's well-being?

Identify leverage points in the system. Try to get some that are cultural/social, some that are policy/political, some that are technological.

### Assignment #2

Play [The Founder](http://thefounder.biz/) and one of the following games and write your thoughts in Canvas. Some things to consider: Was the game challenging and/or engaging? Did the game clearly communicate its ideas and perspective? What were your main takeaways?

Also, try to map out the system underlying the game as well as you can.

You may also play a game not on this list, so long as it is relevant/similar to the ones listed here and you explain why you chose that game.

### Assignment #3

Using the graphics and text techniques we learned, re-create an image you like. It should be your interpretation of that image rather than an exact duplicate.

### Assignment #4

Create a simple game using the interactivity and game state techniques we learned, based off of one of the suggested games in class.

Be prepared to discuss why you made the game you did and explain the decisions that went into it.

Your game should be available online.

### Assignment #5

Form groups of 3 and create a system map related to one of the topics we discussed in class. You'll use this system map as the basis for your game for your final assignment. For example, you could be a warehouse manager trying to keep your job and hit certain targets.

### Final

Develop a game based on your system map from assignment #5.

Be prepared to discuss why you made the game you did and explain the decisions that went into it.
